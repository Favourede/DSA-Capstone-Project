### üìä My Data Analytics Portfolio
Here are some of my recent data analysis case studies:

üìÅ Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis
Description: An in-depth analysis of Amazon product and customer review data to uncover insights for product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. Features a comprehensive Excel dashboard.The goal is to extract key insights from product details such as prices, ratings, reviews, and discounts to help stakeholders understand performance by category and at the product level


## 1. Data Set Description

The dataset contains information about products listed on Amazon Dataset that scraped from Amazon product page, with columns such as: 
‚Ä¢ Product ID 
‚Ä¢ Product Name 
‚Ä¢ Category 
‚Ä¢ Actual Price 
‚Ä¢ Discounted Price 
‚Ä¢ Discount % 
‚Ä¢ Rating 
‚Ä¢ Rating Count 



#### üß© Step 1: Data Cleaning

Performed initial data preparation to ensure consistency and reliability:


‚úÖ Removed Duplicates
Used Product ID as a unique identifier.


Removed duplicates using Excel‚Äôs Remove Duplicates function.

‚úÖ Handled Missing & Error Values
Replaced blank or incorrect ratings with the average rating.


Filled missing values in rating_count, discount_price, and actual_price.


‚úÖ Removed Special Characters
Cleaned actual_price and discount_price by removing commas and pipe (|) symbols.


‚úÖ Text-to-Columns
Used Excel‚Äôs Text to Columns to split combined values (e.g., categories separated by & or other delimiters).



#### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Feature Engineering


Created custom calculated columns to enable deeper insights:


Rating Bucket
=IF(Rating<3,"Low",IF(Rating<4,"Medium","High"))


Discount Value
=Actual Price - Discounted Price


Review Impact Score
=Rating √ó Rating Count


Price Range Bucket
=IF(ActualPrice<200,"<‚Çπ200",IF(ActualPrice<=500,"‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500",">‚Çπ500"))


High Discount Flag
=IF(Discount%>=50,"Yes","No")



#### üìä Step 3: Key Metrics (Dashboard Cards)


Calculated using Excel formulas for quick KPI visibility:


Metric	Formula

Total Products	=COUNTA(ProductID)

Average Rating	=AVERAGE(Rating)

Total Reviews	=SUM(Rating Count)

Average Discount (%)	=AVERAGE(Discount%)

Top Rating	=MAX(Rating)



#### ‚ùì Step 4: Business Questions & Pivot Analysis


Answered 14 business questions using Pivot Tables and custom calculations:
